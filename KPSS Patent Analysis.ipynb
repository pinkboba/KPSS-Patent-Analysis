    "## Experiential Task 1 ##\n",
    "Patents provide an important mechanism for individuals and organizations to protect intellectual property. They encourage innovation and have been extensively linked to firm value. Given their importance to organizations, researchers in economics, finance, and accounting have explored various factors that contribute to patent awards (e.g., R&D expense, industry membership, competition, etc.) and outcomes attributable to patents (e.g., risk profile, executive turnover, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "One very popular study in the area, [Kogan, Papanikolaou, Seru, and Stoffman (*QJE* 2017; hereafter KPSS)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/132/2/665/3076284), quantify the value created by individual patents and show their measure positively predicts future firm growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will use the data provided by KPSS (**KPSS_2022.csv**) and explore how certain features of patents correlate with patent value. Specific requirements include the following:\n",
    "1. Load the KPSS data and restrict it to patent grants approved in January of 2019.\n",
    "2. Merge in the company names using the \"permno\" field and the \"crsp_names.csv\" dataset. Comment on which organization has the highest average value per patent.\n",
    "3. Obtain the original patent grants for these patents from the USPTO using the Bulkdata API.\n",
    "4. Generate a document-term matrix from the patent \"abstract\" (one paragraph summary about patent) and report the 25 most commonly used words and phrases. Use the following criteria for preprocessing and tokenizing your data: \n",
    "    - Include only those tokens that are all letters (alpha) and use lowercase for everything\n",
    "    - Allow for single words and bigrams\n",
    "    - Require tokens be at least 3 characters long\n",
    "    - Exclude stop words\n",
    "    - Restrict the matrix to the 1,000 most common words\n",
    "5. Identify and report the 10 terms that correlate most positively and 10 terms that correlate most negatively with patent value ('xi_real' from the KPSS data)\n",

Specifically, the embodiments disclosed herein generally relate to pivotable lift assist assemblies for agricultural implements.Many types of agricultural implements are used for a variety of tasks, such as cultivating, tilling, planting, and harvesting. For example, seeders and planters are agricultural implements that include devices that create a trench in soil, deposit seeds into the trench, and fill the trench. A seeding/planting agricultural implement may include a central section or bar coupled to a tow bar and wing assemblies coupled to either side of the tow bar. The wing assemblies typically include tool bars that extend perpendicular from the tow bar, row units that perform the farming operation and are mounted on the tool bars, and supporting wheel assemblies disposed along the length of the tool bars. Likewise, other agricultural implements such as cultivators may include transverse members that extend perpendicularly from the tow bar.During the farming operation, the agricultural implement may by towed by a towing vehicle such as a tractor. Further, the agricultural implement may include a lift assist device that may be, for example, coupled to the rear of the agricultural implement. The lift assist device may aid in accommodating some of the weight of the agricultural implement and may also be useful in transporting the agricultural implement. For example, when transporting the seeding/planting agricultural implement, the wing assemblies may be folded for compactness and thus wheels under the wing assemblies may no longer support some the weight of the agricultural implement. The lift assist device may support the weight of the agricultural implement, and thus be used for transport purposes. The lift assist device may additionally or alternatively be used to mount, for example, a bulk fill system or a fertilizer system onto the lift assist device to carry additional systems during farming operations. It would be beneficial to improve structural aspects of the lift assist device.In one embodiment, an agricultural implement system includes a pivotable lift assembly. The pivotable lift assembly includes a first bar member and a second bar member rotatively coupled to the first bar member. The pivotable lift assembly further includes a first wheel assembly disposed on a first end of the second bar member and a second wheel assembly disposed on a second end of the second bar member. The pivotable lift assembly also includes an attachment assembly configured to attach the pivotable lift assembly to an agricultural implement, wherein the pivotable lift assembly is configured to aid in carrying a weight of the agricultural implement.In another embodiment, a pivotable lift assembly system includes a first bar member and a second bar member rotatively coupled to the first bar member. The pivotable lift assembly further includes a first wheel assembly disposed on a first end of the second bar member and a second wheel disposed on a second end of the second bar member. The pivotable lift assembly also includes an attachment assembly configured to attach the pivotable lift assembly to an agricultural implement, wherein the pivotable lift assembly is configured to aid in carrying a weight of the agricultural implement.In a further embodiment, an agricultural implement system includes an agricultural implement and a pivotable lift assembly. The pivotable lift assembly includes a first bar member and a second bar member rotatively coupled to the first bar member. The pivotable lift assembly further includes a first wheel assembly disposed on a first end of the second bar member and a second wheel assembly disposed on a second end of the second bar member. The pivotable lift assembly also includes an attachment assembly configured to attach the pivotable lift assembly to the agricultural implement, wherein the pivotable lift assembly is configured to aid in carrying a weight of the agricultural implement.Agricultural implements, for example, planters, may include wing wheel assemblies to support the implement during various modes of operation (e.g., while turning at a headland, while operating in a planting mode, while transporting the implement, etc.). The wing wheel assemblies may be coupled to a pivotable lift assembly suitable for supporting some of the agricultural implement\\'s weight as well as useful in carrying other systems, such as bulk fill systems, fertilizer systems, and the like. Indeed, a variety of agricultural implements, including implements that are commonly used to perform a variety of tasks (e.g., spraying implements for applying fertilizer, implements for harvesting agricultural product, plowing, preparing beds, etc.) may include the pivotable lift assembly described herein.With agricultural implements that are provided with the pivotable lift assist assembly described herein, the pivotable lift assist assembly may rotate generally about a fore-aft axis to allow for ground contour compensation. Such pivotable structure may reduce structural stress in a ground engaging implement frame. Further, the pivotable lift assist assembly may reduce compaction, for example, when utilizing a bulk fill or fertilizer system on a mounted planter by allowing approximate equal weight on both tire sets. Indeed, rather than ride on a single wheel, in certain ground conditions (e.g., uneven ground conditions), the pivotable lift assist assembly may include a pivot generally about the fore-aft axis, which may advantageously provide for more even weight distribution among the tire sets. Accordingly, the pivotable lift assist assembly may compensate for ground contours and provide for less compaction.With the foregoing in mind,  is a top block view of an embodiment of an agricultural system . The agricultural system  includes an agricultural vehicle  and an agricultural implement . In some embodiments, the agricultural implement  may be towed behind the agricultural vehicle  (e.g., as shown in ). The agricultural vehicle  may be any vehicle suitable for towing the agricultural implement , such as a tractor, off-road vehicle, work vehicle, or the like. The agricultural vehicle  may include a cab , in which an operator sits during operation of the agricultural vehicle . The cab  may be an open or closed cab . Additionally, the agricultural implement  may be any suitable implement, such as a ground-engaging implement (e.g., a soil conditioner, a tillage implement, a fertilizer application implement, a planter, a seeder, etc.) or a sprayer/applicator, suitable for agricultural use. The agricultural implement  may be coupled to the agricultural vehicle  via a hitch system . The hitch  may be a two-point or three-point hitch that rigidly couples the agricultural implement  to the vehicle , such that the implement  can move upward and downward, but cannot freely rotate with respect to the vehicle . It should be understood, however that other systems for coupling the implement  to the vehicle  may be possible. In some embodiments, the implement  may be coupled to the front of the vehicle .As the agricultural implement is towed by the vehicle , some of the weight of the agricultural implement is distributed among wheels . Some of the weight is also being distributed to a pivotable lift assembly . Moreover, if the agricultural implement  includes folding components, some of the wheels  may be folded so as to lift them out of contact with the ground. Additionally wheel  may be raised to lift them out of contact with the ground. Accordingly, the pivotable lift assembly  may support more of the agricultural implement\\'s weight when some of the wheels  are lifted out of contact with the ground.Indeed, the pivotable lift assist assembly  is suitable for engaging the ground to aid in weight distribution of the agricultural implement  and may include certain pivotable embodiments to enable a more even transport of the agricultural implement . In some embodiments, the pivotable lift assist assembly  may include a mounted agricultural system , such as a bulk fill system, a fertilizer system, and so on, shown in dashed lines. The pivotable lift assist assembly  also includes at least two wheel assemblies , , each assembly having one or more wheels. As further described herein, the wheel assemblies , , may move up and down with respect to ground and independent of one another. Accordingly, as the agricultural system  travels over a surface, such as the ground, a road, a field, or another surface in a direction of travel , a first (e.g. fore) bar member  and/or a second (e.g., aft bar member ) may pivot about a pivot point described in more detail below, enabling the up and down movement of the wheel assemblies , . The pivotable lift assembly  may thus enable a more comformable tow that follows ground contours and that may lead to less compaction of soil. It is to be noted that the first bar member  may be disposed fore of the second bar member  with respect to attachment assemblies, aft of the second bar member  with respect to attachment assemblies, above the second bar member  with respect to ground, or below the second ground member  with respect to ground.Turning now to , is a perspective view illustrating an embodiment of the pivotable lift assist assembly  mechanically coupled to an embodiment of the agricultural implement . Because the figure includes like elements from the figure above, the like elements include like element numbers. In the depicted embodiment, the pivotable lift assembly  is connected to the agricultural implement  via two attachment assemblies . The attachment assemblies  may be used to permanently and/or temporarily attach the pivotable lift assist assembly  to the agricultural implement . For example, when permanently attached, the attachment assemblies  may be welded to the agricultural implement , such as to frame . When temporarily attached, the attachment assemblies  may be secured by a variety of fastening techniques, including nuts/bolts, latches, screws, and so on.The attachment assemblies  include two side metal plates , a top plate , and/or a bottom plate (not shown). Bottom portions  of the attachment assemblies  may be mechanically coupled to square bar members  that extend radially away and outwardly from the attachment assemblies . Top portions  of the attachment assemblies  may be mechanically coupled to support members , such as tubular structures, elongated metal plates, rods, and the like. The square bar members  and the support members  may then be mechanically coupled to the fore bar member , for example, via two attachment assemblies .Each of the two attachment assemblies  may include side metal plates  having a square opening or “cut” suitable for disposing the fore bar member  inside of said opening. The fore bar member  may then be welded or otherwise securely fastened onto the attachment assemblies . The fore bar member  attached to the tubular bar members  and then attached to the agricultural implement  forms a rigid square shape. The aft bar member  is then attached to the fore bar member , for example, by using a bolt and nut (e.g., pivoting) assembly . The bolt and nut assembly  enables a rotation or pivoting of the aft bar member  with respect to the fore bar member . Accordingly, a pivot point  may be defined via a fore-aft axis , about which a rotation  of the aft bar member  may be enabled. The assembly  may include a bolt , a nut , and a flange system . The flange system  in turn may include one or more flanges and/or a washers that may reduce rotative friction between the bar members , .As the aft bar member  rotates about the axis , the wheel assemblies ,  may move in an up direction  and a down direction  with respect to ground. Accordingly, ground contours may be more comformably traveled. Also shown in perspective are an axis , , . The axis  is parallel to the fore-aft axis , while axes  and  are both perpendicular to the fore-aft axis . A surface perpendicular to the pivot axis  may control fore-aft movement and yaw between the pivotable lift assembly  and the frame , and may include a pad, a plate, a clip, a roller, and so on.is a front view of an embodiment of the pivotable lift assembly  illustrating the wheel assemblies ,  as having the same height with respect to ground . Because the figure utilizes like elements as those found in the figures above, the like elements are illustrated using like element numbers. As shown, the figure illustrates the pivotable lift assembly  disposed in a mostly even ground . Also shown are cylindrical members , , suitable for coupling with rotatable members , . In operation, the rotatable members , , may rotate about axes ,  respectively. For example, rotations  and  are shown for the rotatable members , . The rotations ,  may include 360° or more. Indeed, in use, the wheel assemblies ,  may rotate freely in any direction in any number of degrees.The wheels for assemblies , , may be mounted onto arm members , suitable for rotatably coupling with the cylindrical members , , for example, via the rotatable members , . In one embodiment, the rotatable members , , may include rods that engage the cylindrical members , , for example, via a bearing system. Other embodiments of the rotatable members ,  may include ball joints, hub assemblies, and the like. The arms are shown, in an exemplary embodiment, as having a curved section  that enables the wheels in the assemblies ,  to be disposed more axially aligned with the cylindrical members , , e.g., directly under the cylindrical members , .While arms  are shown, other embodiments may add or include a variety of wheel suspension systems, including but not limited to wishbone suspension, swing axles, trailing link suspension, MacPherson suspension, A-arm suspensions, and so on. Also shown is a front view of the bolt and nut assembly , about which the rotation  of the aft bar member  may be provided. Indeed, as shown in . The aft bar member  may rotate about the bolt and nut assembly , for example, to better follow ground contours.More specifically,  is a front view illustrating an embodiment of the pivotable lift assist assembly  illustrating the wheel assemblies ,  as having the different heights with respect to uneven ground . Because the figure includes like elements from the figures above, the like elements include like element numbers. As the pivotable lift assist assembly  travels through various types of ground, the wheel assemblies , , may more comformably follow ground contours by pivoting up and down. Accordingly, stresses in components of the pivotable lift assist assembly  and/or the implement  may be reduced. Further, because both wheel assemblies ,  may now contact the ground  more comformably and with more even weight distribution, ground compaction may be reduced.Indeed, by adding rotation  capabilities to the pivotable lift assembly , the agricultural implement  may also experience a reduced stress and more even weight distribution as the pivotable lift assist assembly  may now more easily traverse through variety of ground conditions. As shown, the unlocked second bar member  remains parallel to ground  under the bar member  (e.g., ground under the wheel assemblies , ) while the pivotable lift assembly enables a rotation of the attachment assemblies  with respect to the ground . In some situations, it may be desirable to limit an amount of rotation or travel of the aft bar member , for example, with respect to the fore bar member . Accordingly, a stop travel member, such as a stop travel member  shown in , may be used to provide rotational limits to the aft bar member .More specifically  is a block front view of the pivotable lift assembly  illustrating an embodiment of the stop travel member  suitable for abutting against the aft bar member , thus limiting travel of the aft bar member . It is to be noted that the figure is a block figure and thus the components shown may not be to scale, and/or to scale with respect to each other. The figure also includes the axes , , and  also described in . Because the  includes like elements from the figures above, the like elements include like element numbers. In the figure, the stop travel member  may be disposed to project above (e.g., “overhang”) the aft bar member  so that when the aft bar member  rotates, the aft bar member  may contact the stop travel member . In the depicted embodiment, the stop travel member  may be attached to various components, such as to the fore bar member , via attachment piece .The stop travel member  may be any length, such as a length L between 1 in. and 5 ft or more. Extending the length of the stop travel member  and/or lowering the stop travel member  closer to the aft bar member  may result in less travel or rotation of the aft bar member . Likewise, decreasing the length of the stop travel member  and/or raising the stop travel member  farther from the bar member  may result in more travel of the aft bar member . In some embodiments, such as when the mounted agricultural system  is mounted above the aft bar member , the stop travel member  may be mounted below the aft bar member  as opposed to above the aft bar member .Turning now to , the figure is a block top view of the embodiment of the pivotable lift assembly  illustrating certain locking techniques that may be used. Because the figure includes like elements from the figures above, the like elements include like element numbers. In certain uses, such as during transport, it may be beneficial to “lock” the rotational component(s) of the pivotable lift assembly . For example, the aft bar member  may be securely fastened onto the fore bar member  to minimize or eliminate any movement, such as rotational movement. Accordingly,  illustrates two locking assemblies  suitable for fastening the fore bar member  to the aft bar member . More specifically, the figure is a block diagram top view of the two bar members ,  showing details  of the locking assemblies . The figure also includes the axes , , and  also described in .In the depicted embodiment, the locking assembly  includes a key or locking member . When in use, the locking member may first be inserted through openings  disposed in both of the bar members ,  so that an opening  protrudes behind the fore bar member . Following the insertion of the locking member , a pin (e.g., cotter pin)  may be inserted through the opening  to secure the locking member . While the depicted embodiment shows the locking assembly  disposed in two locations, the location assembly  may be disposed in one or more locations along lengths of the bar members , . In this manner, the locking assembly or assemblies  may be used, for example, during road transport of the pivotable lift assembly .Also shown are the bolt and nut assembly  and the flange system . As mentioned earlier, the aft bar member  may pivot with respect to the fore bar member  about the bolt and nut assembly . The flange system  may include smooth flanges (e.g., steel, PVC, ABS, plastic) that would minimize friction between the aft bar member  and the fore bar member , enabling a smoother rotation. By providing a pivotable lift assembly , the techniques described herein may provide for more comformable towing of agricultural implements , thus extending equipment life and improving yields.While only certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the invention.\"],\"grantDocumentIdentifier\":\"US10172275B2\",\"grantDate\":\"01-08-2019\",\"patentNumber\":\"10172275\"}],\"recordTotalQuantity\":1}'"

    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "From this simple analysis, it appears that the text in the abstract does not correlate strongly with the patent value (xi_real).  The correlation coefficients are relatively low, indicating that there isn't a strong linear relationship between the words in the abstract and the patent value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Intuitive Correlations: \"managing\" and \"methods\" possibly have positive correlations because patents usually involve methods and management processes, that could associate with higher value.  \"invention relates\" having a positive correlation makes sense since it ties into the purpose or scope of the patent, indicating it's value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Suprising Correlations: \"substrate\" and \"layer\" these words could typically be used in patents related to materials or technology.  In certain industries, one might assume these terms to be associated with high value patents.  \"first\" and \"second\" strangely are negatively correlated, while these words could be used to describe steps or components in a patent, which could be expected to correlated with a detailed and valuable patent.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some correlations match with intuition or expectations, the low magnitude of correlation coefficients suggests there are more diverse factors beyond the abstract of a patent's  text that play a critical role in determining patent value.  "
